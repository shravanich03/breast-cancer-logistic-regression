Breast Cancer Logistic Regression
This project is part of an AI & ML internship. The goal is to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to predict if a tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

📌 Objectives:
Train-test split and feature scaling

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate using precision, recall, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix

Tune threshold and explain sigmoid function
